# AutoYaST-specific Desktop Files

The files included in this directory are installed in the `/usr/share/autoinstall/modules` and are
only used by AutoYaST. The format of those files is [documented in the yast2
repository](https://github.com/yast/yast-yast2/blob/master/doc/desktop_file.md). Additionally, these
files are used in order to decide which sections are included in the schema (check the
`src/autoyast-rnc` directory for the schema definition files).
